# Data-Center--lab
A simulated home lab for data center operations using Proxmox and pfSense
# Self-Built Data Center Lab

This project simulates a multi-tenant data center environment using home hardware and open-source tools.

## Technologies Used
- Proxmox (Hypervisor)
- Ubuntu Server (VM OS)
- pfSense (Firewall/VLAN management)
- Physical cabling (Ethernet/fiber simulation)

## Key Features
- VLAN segmentation and DHCP/DNS setup
- Server provisioning and test workloads
- Patch panel simulation and labeling
- Asset tracking and DCIM-style documentation

## Goals
To develop hands-on infrastructure skills including racking/stacking, cabling, virtualization, and firewall config.
